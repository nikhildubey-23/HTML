    <u><h1>Third Module Is All About Page Layout</h1></u>

    <p>We use the right tag in right place it results  in a better indexing by search engines and better user exprience.</p>
    <h3><u>The structure looks like: </u></h3>
    <pre>
       header :- inside the header mainly we use the nav tag that we will see.

       main:- in main , main body of the content are there means which we want to show in the page no matter that it is a paragraph or any link or any image it could be anything 

       footer:- footer is the last part of the web page where mainly we use to put "About","contact" etc
       
    </pre>
    <u><h3>INSIDE MAIN TAG :-</h3></u> 
       <pre>
            we start with opening main tag 
            then we use section tag 
            after that we use atricle tag where we put our main content 
            then we use aside tag where we use to put ads etc
            then we use closing main tag
       </pre>

    <!-- Now we see how to link web page into another web page  -->
    <a href="/contact.html" target="_blank">contact us</a>
    <!-- this is how we use to add the link of another webpage -->

    <!-- now lets make some crazy stuf and that is when we click on an image of google we directly render into google website
    -->
    <h3><u>if you click on google image you will directly render on google web page </u></h3>
