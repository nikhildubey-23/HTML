For to learn html language i use vscode as a text editor and live server extension to run my web site which is use to host on my local server.

so motivate your self and start working on html .

one famous quote by one of my fav scientist name Dennis Ritchie :-
    "The only way to learn a new 
    programming language is by writing programs in it.
